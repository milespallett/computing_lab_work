 * to a valid, default value, and return a pointer to 
 * allocated Stack (or NULL, in the event of an error)

	// using malloc, and assign the pointer to the  
	// allocated memory (returned by malloc) into the 
	// pStack variable

	// check for memory allocation failure...

	// if the value returned by malloc is 'NULL'

		// to a Stack to be returned OR a value of NULL in the event
		// of failure to create the Stack. So, we will return 
		// a value of NULL on this occasion.
